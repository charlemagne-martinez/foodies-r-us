Curry, M (March 2024) nodejs-starter-app [Adapated source code for the following: CRUD functions, queries, app routes, pages implementations, database setup] 
https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app

*** We used the nodejs-starter-app github page provided to us by Profressor Curry on multiple pages and files. For simplicity sake, we summed them all up with the lastest date we accessed them. Please refer to each file for more specific uses of our adaptations from the website. Specifically, please refer to the db-connector.js in the database folder, the delete[entityName].js files in the static folder,
all the handlebars files in views -> pages folder, and app.js as needed.
