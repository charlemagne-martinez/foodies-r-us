                        CouchPotato Saga presents an up-and-coming platform for food enthusiasts called Foodies R Us! This platform currently 
                        manages a database of over 20,000 restaurant locations that users have explored throughout the U.S. With over 1 million 
                        active users and growing, Foodies R Us is experiencing rapid growth. Such growth presents the challenge of handling vast 
                        amounts of data. As such, Foodies R Us recognizes the need for a robust data-driven application to support its expanding user base. 
                        This application will record user-generated data, including restaurant names and record of reviews. With this system in place, 
                        Foodies R Us can provide a positive user experience, facilitate quick searches for preferred dining spots, and offer valuable insights 
                        into popular or trending locations.
