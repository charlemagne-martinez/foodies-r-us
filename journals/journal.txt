    - Restaurants FK dropdown UPDATE WORKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. 
    - Restaurants FK dropdown is now updated such that option goes to current selected one for particular record
    - Users DELETE now updates table again w/o having to reload page. Will do same for other entities
    - Restaurants, Locations, Reviews, CuisineTypes, RestaurantChains, RestaurantCuisines (AKA every other entity)
      tables, when deleting a record, updates w/o having to refresh page again
    - Added a 'NULL' option for chain in Restaurants add and delete


Things found to fix / To-do / thoughts to consider later (if we can get to it): 
    - UI stuff (based on Alexander's feedback, what visuals we like change)

    - data input validation for specific fields? (like email in users page?)
    - validation for RC add to avoid duplicates. AKA should have contraint handling for RC INSERT/UPDATE. 
      Duplicates specifically such that dropdown is updated based on previously selected values (vice versa)

    - Add error handle for fields that are not populated or have input. Data validation handling 
    - in app route, if data is null, then reroute
