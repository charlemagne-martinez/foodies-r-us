Todo : 
    - UPDATE (Update),
    - rename updatePerson.js file to updateUser.js
    - make column names more human readable? (noticed it being finicky when displaying data tho...)
    


    (thoughts to consider later)
    - regarding deleteUser.js, see if what we have to update dropdown option for update user when deleting a record works...
    - regarding updating records, maybe consider having a dropdown corresponding to the primary key ID
    - for Restaurants when adding and updating entry, consider having a dropdown for cuisine type that hooks
      up similarly to automatically insert similar to TA's method
