2/28:
    - decided on doing Users entity
    - got READ (Select) working
2/29:
    - got CREATE (Insert) working
    - DELETE (Delete) WORKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
    - UPDATE (Update) TEEHEE (dropdown corresponding to primary key ID works)
    - made column names more human readable (in Users page; currently hardcoded)

3/6: 
    - Review UPDATE works with app.js {BWY}
    - NEED to fix textarea on Review UPDATE for styling {BWY}
    - Reviews overall works for all crud
    - RestaurantChains works for all crud
    - CuisineTypes works for CRU. DELETE left

3/7:
    - fixed Reviews SELECT not being in order by reviewID
    - CuisineTypes DELETE works
    - Locations CRUD all works

3/13:
    - Changed Modal Update for Users, Locations, Chains, CuisineTypes, Reviews
    - RetaurantCuisines has issue when adding if it already exists
    - RC add + read is done
    - Restaurants page: location and chain are no longer the ID, 
    dropdowns for adding are dynamic now. ADD doesn't work, 
    INSERT works
    - reminder: NO LONGER using hidden inputs ;_;

3/14:
    THINGS found:
    - FOUND WEIRD ERROR. Deleting a record (tested w/ ALL entities, including intersection tables)
      doesn't visually remove it from table until you reload page. not sure what changed since last week
      so troubleshoot this later.
    - Should change dropdowns when editing a record to be the current option

    - RestaurantCuisines dropdown for adding a record and editing are now dynamic. 
      HOWEVER, after making dynamic, INSERT does not seem to work anymore ;/

- LEFT TO DO:
- Restaurants: UPDATE (FK dropdown for Location/Chain doesn't get updated if different selection made...)
- RestaurantCuisines: UPDATE needs route and needs to work. created a route but may have to update again...
- need contraint handling for RC INSERT/UPDATE. Duplicates specifically such that
    dropdown is updated based on previously selected values (vice versa)
- UI stuff (based on Alexander's feedback, what visuals we like change)
    
3/16:
    - RestaurantCuisine DELETE works
    - RestaurantCuisine INSERT WORKS AGAIN EUSHAHAHDHAFJSDFOIHWIDJFWK
    - Review UPDATE does not work with apostrophe. 3/16 UPDATE: Fixed it seems kinda. 
      If a review has more than one apostrophre tho, seems to get truncated to before that second one
    - 

Todo : 
    

    (thoughts to consider later)
    - when we get to Locations, consider removing the UPDATE step as we don't see it making sense
    - see why adding script tag for updateUser.js in users.handlebars for the UPDATE does not work.... 
      also see if it's alright to keep that script in the users.handlebars like how we have it rn
    - regarding deleteUser.js, see if what we have to update dropdown option for update user when deleting a record works...
    - for Restaurants when adding and updating entry, consider having a dropdown for cuisine type that hooks
      up similarly to automatically insert similar to TA's method mentioned in ed post?
      AKA Could possibly handle RestaurantCuisines intersection table within form in Restaurants, 
      where we allow users to choose the cuisine type, instead of having another form specifically 
      in RestaurantCuisines where we allow the user to choose restaurant and cuisine type

    - input validation?
    - validation for RC add to avoid duplicates
    - add drop downs in modal updates for rest of entities suchs as restaurants, reviews, RC 


    
    - For some reason, for reviews.handlebars in particular, relateive file path was found for deleteReview.js
    but not found or referenced when clicking on the delete button. As of rn, deleteReview.js file contents directly
    in script.

    - Add error handle for fields that are not populated or have input. Data validation handling 
    - in app route, if data is null, then reroute
